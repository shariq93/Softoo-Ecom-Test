# Softoo React Native Test

This project is created as per the requirments provided by **Sooftoo.co**.

### Requirments
- A user should be able to:
- View a list of products, with their price/info

## Project Details

In this project, the chosen state management library is **Redux**, along with **Redux-Observable** as middleware and **Axios** as the API client. This combination of technologies enables efficient state management and asynchronous operations.

### Unit Testing
Using **Jest** for testing for now I just wrote test for **CartReducer** due to time constrain you can run test by running `yarn jest CartReducer`.
You can find the test file `project > src > store > reducer > CartReducer.test.ts`.
