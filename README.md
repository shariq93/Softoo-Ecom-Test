## Project Details

This project is built using [Ignite-cli](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite), which offers nearly everything required to kickstart a project. It saves a significant amount of time and effort by providing boilerplate code for state management, navigation, and more.

#### State Managment
This project utilizes **Mobx State Tree** as the state management library, which is integrated by default in **ignite-cli** projects. MST enforces type safety, and when combined with **TypeScript**, it grants you complete control over your application's data types.

### Unit Testing
Using **Jest** for testing for now I just wrote test for **CartModel** due to time constrain you can run test by running `yarn test Cart`.
You can find the test file `project > app > models > Cart.test.ts`.
